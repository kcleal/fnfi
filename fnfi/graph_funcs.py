def blockmodel(G, partitions):
    """Stolen from NetworkX 1.9. Returns a reduced graph constructed using the generalized block modeling
    technique. Faster than the quotient graph method, but not by much.

    The blockmodel technique collapses nodes into blocks based on a
    given partitioning of the node set.  Each partition of nodes
    (block) is represented as a single node in the reduced graph.

    Edges between nodes in the block graph are added according to the
    edges in the original graph.  If the parameter multigraph is False
    (the default) a single edge is added with a weight equal to the
    sum of the edge weights between nodes in the original graph
    The default is a weight of 1 if weights are not specified.  If the
    parameter multigraph is True then multiple edges are added each
    with the edge data from the original graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A networkx Graph or DiGraph
    partitions : list of lists, or list of sets
        The partition of the nodes.  Must be non-overlapping.
    multigraph : bool, optional
        If True return a MultiGraph with the edge data of the original
        graph applied to each corresponding edge in the new graph.
        If False return a Graph with the sum of the edge weights, or a
        count of the edges if the original graph is unweighted.

    Returns
    -------
    blockmodel : a Networkx graph object

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G=nx.path_graph(6)
    >>> partition=[[0,1],[2,3],[4,5]]
    >>> M=nx.blockmodel(G,partition)

def find_cycle(G, source=None, orientation=None):
    """Stolen from networkX 2
    Returns a cycle found via depth-first traversal.

    The cycle is a list of edges indicating the cyclic path.
    Orientation of directed edges is controlled by `orientation`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A directed/undirected graph/multigraph.

    source : node, list of nodes
        The node from which the traversal begins. If None, then a source
        is chosen arbitrarily and repeatedly until all edges from each node in
        the graph are searched.

    orientation : None | 'original' | 'reverse' | 'ignore' (default: None)
        For directed graphs and directed multigraphs, edge traversals need not
        respect the original orientation of the edges.
        When set to 'reverse' every edge is traversed in the reverse direction.
        When set to 'ignore', every edge is treated as undirected.
        When set to 'original', every edge is treated as directed.
        In all three cases, the yielded edge tuples add a last entry to
        indicate the direction in which that edge was traversed.
        If orientation is None, the yielded edge has no direction indicated.
        The direction is respected, but not reported.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : directed edges
        A list of directed edges indicating the path taken for the loop.
        If no cycle is found, then an exception is raised.
        For graphs, an edge is of the form `(u, v)` where `u` and `v`
        are the tail and head of the edge as determined by the traversal.
        For multigraphs, an edge is of the form `(u, v, key)`, where `key` is
        the key of the edge. When the graph is directed, then `u` and `v`
        are always in the order of the actual directed edge.
        If orientation is not None then the edge tuple is extended to include
        the direction of traversal ('forward' or 'reverse') on that edge.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoCycle
        If no cycle was found.

    Examples
    --------
    In this example, we construct a DAG and find, in the first call, that there
    are no directed cycles, and so an exception is raised. In the second call,
    we ignore edge orientations and find that there is an undirected cycle.
    Note that the second call finds a directed cycle while effectively
    traversing an undirected graph, and so, we found an "undirected cycle".
    This means that this DAG structure does not form a directed tree (which
    is also known as a polytree).
